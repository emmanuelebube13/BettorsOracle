# BettorsOracle

## Overview

BettorsOracle is a machine learning–driven web application for predicting football match outcomes using statistical modeling and historical performance data.

The project aims to research, design, and deploy predictive systems capable of estimating match probabilities (win/draw/loss and other betting markets) through data-driven methodologies.

This repository represents an active research and development effort. The system is currently under continuous improvement and structural refinement.

## Objectives

1. Build reliable predictive models for football outcomes
2. Implement automated data ingestion pipelines
3. Evaluate model performance using statistical validation metrics
4. Create a scalable backend for model inference
5. Develop a web-based interface for prediction visualization
6. Continuously improve prediction accuracy through research and iteration

## Installation (Development Environment)

Prerequisites:

* Python 3.9+
* pip
* Virtual environment recommended

Example setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emmanuelebube13/BettorsOracle.git
cd BettorsOracle
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Further setup instructions will be documented as the application layer is finalized.

## Model Development Philosophy

This project follows:

* Empirical validation over assumptions
* Backtesting before deployment
* Strict separation of training and evaluation datasets
* Continuous performance monitoring
* Conservative interpretation of predictive probabilities

No model is considered valid without statistical validation.

## Roadmap

Phase 1 – Data Structuring

* Clean historical datasets
* Normalize team performance metrics
* Build reusable data ingestion pipeline

Phase 2 – Model Optimization

* Hyperparameter tuning
* Cross-league generalization testing
* Reduce overfitting

Phase 3 – Backend API

* RESTful prediction endpoints
* Authentication system
* Usage logging

Phase 4 – Frontend Application

* User interface for match selection
* Prediction visualization
* Probability breakdown

Phase 5 – Deployment

* Docker containerization
* Cloud infrastructure
* Domain and production rollout
